# Weather Prediction Data Science Challenge

Every year, Node students engage in a friendly battle of machine learning models

The Node staff finds a dataset, reserves a portion of it for testing and then gives you guys a training dataset

This year, you all will be predicting whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia.

You will be given a dataset in the csv file `node_s19_ml_competition_train.csv`. **The goal of this challenge is to predict the `RainTomorrow` column given every other column.**

**Below is an example project containing an exploration section and a guide to how to submit your model**
